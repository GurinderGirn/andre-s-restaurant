Andre's restaurant - showcasing javascript skills
This Project was developed in a team of five web developers to showcase JavaScript skills. This restaurant website was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. I act as a Front-End developer in this project and developed Home, Reservation, Photo gallery and contact pages.The main challenge was to develop a game that should be impossible to win by customers.

The website's development was focused to be cross-browser compatible. So it would be possible to effortlessly launch it into any browser without making any changes to the main application. It was a team project. I lead the team and designed logo of website. In this project, we followed standard conventions to maintain consistency.
